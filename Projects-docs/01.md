The Jupyter community is composed of several sub-communities and projects. These are organized around particular use-cases, users, or other aspects of the Jupyter community. This section contains information to help navigate these projects both from the perspective of a user and a community member.
Jupyter 社区由几个子社区和项目组成。这些是围绕特定用例、用户或 Jupyter 社区的其他方面组织的。本节包含的信息可帮助从用户和社区成员的角度浏览这些项目。
